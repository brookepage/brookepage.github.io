    <p> Joseph Beuys
      <br> Everyone Is An Artist
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “Let yourself fall.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Learn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to observe snails
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Plant &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; impossible gardens.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let someone dangerous &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in for tea. 
      <br> &nbsp; Make small signs that say &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“yes” 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; and spread them all over &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your house. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Become a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;friend &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of freedom and uncertainty.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look forward &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dreaming.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cry at &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the movies. 
      <br> &nbsp;Swing as high as you can on a swing at moonlight. 
      <br> &nbsp;Maintain different moods. Refuse to be “responsible”. 
      <br> &nbsp;Do it out of love. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Take a lot of naps.
      <br> &nbsp;Pass on money. Do it now. The money will follow.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Laugh a lot. Bathe in the moonlight. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dream wild, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; imaginative dreams.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Draw &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; walls.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Read &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; every &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; day. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Imagine &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you are enchanted.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Giggle with &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;children. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Listen to old people. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Open yourself. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dive in. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be free. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Praise Yourself. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let go of fear.
      <br> Play with everything. Preserve the child in you. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are innocent. Build a castle of covers. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Get wet.
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hug trees. 
      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Write love letters.”
