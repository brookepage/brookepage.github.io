<p> “Let yourself fall. Learn to observe snails.
  <br> &nbsp; Plant impossible gardens. Let someone d
  <br> &nbsp; angerous in for tea. Make small signs tha
  <br> &nbsp; t say “yes” and spread them all over your
  <br> &nbsp; house. Become a friend of freedom and u
  <br> &nbsp; ncertainty. Look forward to dreaming. Cr
  <br> &nbsp; y at the movies. Swing
  <br> &nbsp; as high as you can on a &nbsp; &nbsp; swing at moon
  <br> &nbsp; light. Maintain differen &nbsp; &nbsp; t moods. Refu
  <br> &nbsp; se to be “responsible”. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do it out of lo
  <br> &nbsp; ve. Take a lot of naps. P &nbsp; &nbsp; ass on money.
  <br> &nbsp; Do it now. The money &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will follow. L
  <br> &nbsp; augh a lot. Bathe in the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;moonlight. Dr
  <br> &nbsp; eam wild, imaginative &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dreams. Draw
  <br> &nbsp; on the walls. Read eve
  <br> &nbsp; ry day. Imagine you are enchanted. Giggl
  <br> &nbsp; e with children. Listen to old people. Ope
  <br> &nbsp; n yourself. Dive in. Be free. Praise Yours
  <br> &nbsp; elf. Let go of fear. Play with everything. P
  <br> &nbsp; reserve the child in you. You are innocent. 
  <br> &nbsp; Build a castle of covers. Get wet. Hug tre
  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; es. Write love letters.”
